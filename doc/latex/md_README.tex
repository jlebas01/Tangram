\subsection*{How to play}

When you have launch the game with {\ttfamily ./tangram} you can play now.

\paragraph*{Launch}

You can create a new puzzle board if you click on {\ttfamily Launch} and use these commands to play \+: ~\newline
 {\ttfamily click left} on a shape to move it. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily click right} on a shape to rotate it. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}Esc\textquotesingle{}} to exit this mode. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}s\textquotesingle{}} to save the current board as puzzle. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}d\textquotesingle{}} on a shape to rotate the shape as 45° anti clock. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}f} on a shape to rotate the shape as 45° clock. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}} to reverse the shape as symmetry. ~\newline
 Note that last command rotate every shape as 180° except parallelogram is overturned like a mirror ~\newline
 ~\newline
 \paragraph*{Load}

If you click on {\ttfamily Load} you can load a puzzle file and try to resolve it. To play this mode you can use these commands below \+: ~\newline
 {\ttfamily click left} on a shape to move it. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily click right} on a shape to rotate it. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}Esc\textquotesingle{}} to exit this mode. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}d\textquotesingle{}} on a shape to rotate the shape as 45° anti clock. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}f} on a shape to rotate the shape as 45° clock. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily press \textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{}} to reverse the shape as symmetry. ~\newline
 Note that last command rotate every shape as 180° except parallelogram is overturned like a mirror ~\newline
